<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>The game 13 of Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 will see Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) take on Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

Both the teams pretty much have had a similar result pattern in this tournament, including a Super Over-heartbreak.

While KXIP lost their opening game against Delhi Capitals (DC), they followed it up with a win against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) before suffering a defeat at the hands of Rajasthan Royals (RR).

Meanwhile, MI lost the season opener against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) but returned to winning ways, defeating Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). However, MI had to encounter their second defeat when they faced RCB.

<p><h3 align=center><b>What to Expect</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p> This will be the first taste of Sharjah for both teams this year. The pitch is likely to be a fresh one, but that's unlikely to impact what we've seen already on this ground. Expect plenty of sixes and don't forget that a really big match-turning over is possible here at any point in the game. Say no to foregone conclusions.
