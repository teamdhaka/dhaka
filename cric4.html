<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>The game 13 of Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 will see Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) take on Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

Both the teams pretty much have had a similar result pattern in this tournament, including a Super Over-heartbreak.

While KXIP lost their opening game against Delhi Capitals (DC), they followed it up with a win against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) before suffering a defeat at the hands of Rajasthan Royals (RR).

Meanwhile, MI lost the season opener against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) but returned to winning ways, defeating Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). However, MI had to encounter their second defeat when they faced RCB.

<p><h3 align=center><b>What to Expect</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>A bigger ground means spinners will come into play a lot more at Abu Dhabi. Chasing has remained the preferred choice of captains winning the toss, despite stats telling otherwise. The team that adapts quickly, to conditions and ground size, may come out on top. MI have a slight advantage there, having played two of their three games here while it's the first time at this venue for Rahul & Co, who have been only in high scoring encounters at the comparatively smaller grounds.</p>
