<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will be up against each other in the sixth match of IPL 2020. This will be the second match for both the teams as they have played one game each. KXIP lost a close encounter against Delhi Capitals, whereas RCB won a tight game against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Both teams had their first game at the same venue and hence the players should be familiar with the conditions. The Kings XI Punjab team has a lot of Karnataka and some ex-RCB players so it would be intriguing to watch them come up against the RCB team.

Both teams have a strong batting line-up and it should be a cracking T20 contest on Thursday.</p>

<p><h3 align=center><b> Pitch Report</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>Two matches have been played at this venue so far and we have seen that it is not the best of wickets to bat on. In both matches a score around 160 was defended and we can expect something similar in this game as well. Fast bowlers have enjoyed success in the initial two games, so that trend might continue in this game.
