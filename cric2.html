<br>
<p>It’s Virat Kohli versus Rohit Sharma. It’s Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) versus Mumbai Indians (MI) in the 10th match of the Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday.

MI come into this contest on the back of a comfortable win against Kolkata Knight Riders. While skipper Rohit Sharma led from the front, hitting a brisk 80, Suryakumar Yadav scored an attractive 47. The MI pace battery of Jasprit Bumrah, James Pattinson and Trent Boult looked well-oiled too.

RCB had won their opening game of the season against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), but in their second match, they were done in by a stunning KL Rahul hundred. The success of Kings XI Punjab’s spin-bowling duo of Ravi Bishnoi and Murugan Ashwin in addition to some fine pace-bowling display from Mohammad Shami and Sheldon Cottrell made matters worse for RCB. </p>

<p><h3 align=center><b> Pitch Report</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>Four games have been played in Dubai, two of them by RCB. Teams that have won the toss have elected to field and failed to chase down the target on each occasion. In the most recent game, CSK were undone by the lack of dew and a wicket that slowed down progressively. With humidity in the low 40s, expect a possible inversion to the chase-first doctrine of T20s.
