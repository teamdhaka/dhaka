<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p> Struggling to find half decent starts with the bat, Chennai Super Kings ideally wouldn't have liked this match up early on against the best bowling side in powerplays in IPL 2020, the Kings XI Punjab. And yet here they are, playing their third straight game in Dubai on Sunday, and desperately searching for a win to snap their three-match losing streak since the opening night. CSK have the lowest average, second-lowest run-rate and have lost the joint most wickets inside the first six overs this powerplay - just what KXIP might have wanted though to turn their campaign around. </p>

<p><h3 align=center><b> What To Expect</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>SRH's victory in CSK's last outing here was just another instance of team batting first winning the game in IPL 2020, though it was David Warner who opted to put runs on the board that match. Chasing, however, has been preferred by the two captains who'll be at the toss tomorrow. Expect the trend to continue, in anticipation of dew, even as the early trend suggests otherwise.
