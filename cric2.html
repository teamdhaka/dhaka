<p><h3 align=center><b> What To Expect</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>This being the first of the last two games in Sharjah will be played on a newer (relatively) wicket. The T20 axiom has shifted ever so steadily at this venue with chasing teams winning each of the last four fixtures. MS Dhoni summed up this switch when he said: "There is just enough dew to make it slightly better and that creates a difference between the first and the second innings. It becomes slightly more difficult to score in the first innings in the middle overs and slightly easier in the middle overs of the second innings."
