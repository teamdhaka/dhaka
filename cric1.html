A less humid weather with plenty of sun.

Abu Dhabi has been a bit of a mixed bag. While seven of the last eight games (with an outright result) at the venue were won by the chasing side, the trend in afternoon games has been different - 3 wins in 4 games (including a Super Over) by the teams batting first.

Chris Gayle and Nicholas Pooran vs CSK's spinners in the middle could be a game-changer. Pooran has 25 sixes in 13 outings while Gayle has smashed 23 of them in just six. Whichever combination of spinners CSK pick, they will all naturally turn the ball into the two left-handers and have very little margin for error.
