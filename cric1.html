<br>
<p>
It’s match-day 9 in the Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 as Rajasthan Royals (RR) square off against Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Sunday.

RR made a solid start to their IPL 2020 campaign, beating Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 16 runs. While Sanju Samson and Steve Smith scored an impressive 74 and 69 respectively, and Jofra Archer chipped in with a quickfire 27* off 8, Rahul Tewatia picked up three to power RR to a win.

Coming to KXIP, they bounced back in style following a Super Over-defeat against Delhi Capitals and beat Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on the back of a KL Rahul batting masterclass on Thursday. KXIP spinners – Ravi Bishnoi and Murugan Ashwin – played their part to seal a big 97-run win.

With RR and KXIP both looking to continue their winning run and add two more points to their account, we may witness a mouth-watering clash in Sharjah and here are our picks who could make a difference to the fortunes of their teams.</p>
