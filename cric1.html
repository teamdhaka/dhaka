<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>One of these two teams will surely open their account in the points table as Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) square off against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the eighth match of the Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020. at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

While SRH lost their first game of the season against Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), the Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians (MI) defeated KKR, led by Dinesh Karthik in their season opener.

For SRH, they looked in contention to win their first game against RCB. But their middle-order did not enjoy a good outing and it was SRHâ€™s undoing. While Jonny Bairstow Bairstow and Manish Pandey did their bit, there was not much from the other SRH batsmen. 

KKR too will want their batsmen to come good following their defeat against Mumbai Indians. While Dinesh Karthik scored 30 and Pat Cummins scored a quickfire 33, KKR will need a lot more from their batting unit and will hope that their bowlers hunt in a pack.  

In their last five games, it is SRH who holds an upper hand with three wins and KKR will be eager to make it 3-3 as the teams face off for the sixth time over the period of three years.  

As both the teams seek to add two points to their account, here are the five players who could make a difference in the game to be played at Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi</p>

<p><h3 align=center><b> Pitch Report</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>UAE surfaces are always on the slower side.The pitch is expected to be on the slower side assisting spinners, just like the way most pitches have been. Spinners would play a massive role in the clash and dew will also play a factor. Dew will set in in the evening when the Sunsets and that will help the batting. The average run rate in T20 Internationals at Abu Dhabi is 7.00, so if the team batting first can muster a score of 150+, they will be well in the game.
The match will start at 6:00pm local time(07:30PM IST) on what will be a hot day. No rain is expected whatsoever.</p>
