<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>We are almost there. The wait is almost over. The first game of the Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 is just a few hours away.

While it will be a behind-the-closed-doors event, there will not be any shortage of entertainment as the blockbuster Mumbai Indians (MI) versus Chennai Super Kings (CSK) game will kick-start the IPL proceedings at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

The two teams, who last faced each other in the IPL 2019 final, have always been involved in fascinating contests and it wonâ€™t be different when they square off in the IPL 2020 opener in the United Arab Emirates.

The big game means that the teams will stack up their line-up with their match-winners.</p>
