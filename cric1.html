<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>We are almost there. The wait is almost over. The first game of the Dream11 Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 is just a few hours away.

While it will be a behind-the-closed-doors event, there will not be any shortage of entertainment as the blockbuster Mumbai Indians (MI) versus Chennai Super Kings (CSK) game will kick-start the IPL proceedings at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

The two teams, who last faced each other in the IPL 2019 final, have always been involved in fascinating contests and it wonâ€™t be different when they square off in the IPL 2020 opener in the United Arab Emirates.

The big game means that the teams will stack up their line-up with their match-winners.</p>

<p><h3 align=center><b> Pitch Report</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>UAE surfaces are always on the slower side. This will be the case again, with batting earlier in the tournament expected to be easier before the squares become tired due to plenty of action. The average run rate in T20 Internationals at Abu Dhabi is 7.00, so if the team batting first can muster a score of 150+, they will be well in the game.

The match will start at 6:00pm local time(07:30PM IST) on what will be a hot day. No rain is expected whatsoever.</p>
