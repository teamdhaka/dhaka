<p><h3 align=center><b>Preview</b></h3></p>
<br>
<p>At the end of an intense Royal Challengers Bangalore's training session that saw Navdeep Saini crack Virat Kohli's bat with a pacy delivery, bowling coach Adam Griffith got his quick men to aim at a water bottle placed on the edge of the tram line. It was similar to the yorker challenge the team had partaken in during the pre-season camp with the added caveat that the full, pacy ball now had to be delivered away from the imaginary batsman's reach. Saini continued to be excellent while Umesh Yadav also fixed his worry lines as the session wore on.
